# Jai's First CS193 Homework

My favorite things about CS 193 include: 
 - How chill the class is
 - How it's only once a week
 - The fact that I now know how to use GitHub
 - How easy this homework assignment is
 - **Gonna** randomly _put_ words `here` to see how they look

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
